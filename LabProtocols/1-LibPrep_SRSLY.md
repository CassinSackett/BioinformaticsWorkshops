NGS LIBRARY PREPARATION PROTOCOL vi ClaretBio SRSLY kit

General Steps: 
DNA quantification per sample and DNA calculation to sonication 
DNA fragmentation/Target selection
Library preparation using SRSLY NGS KIT and DNA purification using Beads
PCR and adapter indexing (Incubation, Index and PCR)
Quality control (Final DNA library quantification)
Bioanalyzer  

FIRST  AND SECOND STEPS::
FIRST STEP:
DNA Concentration and calculus to run the DNA sonication process

Before Starting: 
Clean the space you will use with EtOH 70%
Get ready and crosslink the whole material for at least 5 min (300 seg)


Gloves
PCR Tubes single connection
Sharpies
QuBit tubes (for samples and standard solutions) 

Tips 10 uL and 200 uL

 
Note: Don’t crosslink QuBit tubes because they’ll change the color and mess up the results. 

Take DNA samples out of the freezer and let them thaw
Take Qubit kit out of the fridge. Qbit Kit = 2 Standard Solution (SS1 and SS2) and 1 Working Solution (WS) (light sensible). Allow reagents to come to room temperature before using. Cold WS can affect concentration read. 
Fill up 2L of milli-Q H2O and put it in the fridge. It’s not mandatory, but helps you to speed up the process in the sonicator). 

Note: Remember milli-Q H2O should be taken at 18.2 mncm TC MQRest (about filter). If it’s not in that measure just let it drain a little until it reaches the recommended value. You can take distilled water either. 

Procedure: 
DNA concentration

Prepare and label each PCR tube according to your samples, add 2 additional tubes for SS1 and SS2. 
Add 199 uL Qubit WS to each sample tube. 
Add 190 uL Qubit WS to each standard tube. 
Spin 5 seg

Note: Remember to keep the tubes covered with aluminum foil to prevent damage to the WS reagent. 

Add 1 uL DNA sample to each tube with WS. Inmediatly vórtex 5 seg.
Add 10 uL of SS1 and SS2 in the correpond tubes. 
Spin 5 seg whole tubes
Go ahead to Qubit machine, follow on-screen prompts, and take note of DNA concentration (1 uL/ng is enough for DNA library preps)

Note: Usually is used samples 1x dsDNA. 

Discard Qubit tubes

Open the Calculation Google Sheet and run it to know the appropriate volumes to follow library preparation.

Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZTH6LL4ubLh1Np5cHxSSZh0R0uqNqRRxn6KZXiYAJcA/edit#gid=12225278 







SECOND STEP:
DNA Sonication Process

Procedure: 
As you know the values to the DNA sonication process, add those values to PCR tubes. 
	*Add H2O volume 
	*Add DNA volume
	*Vortex and spin slow for 5 seg
	*Separate tubes (just in case)

Note: QSonica works with 18 samples, you always have to complete this “sample number”. If it’s needed use additional tubes with H2O, these tubes fill up until a half of the total sample volume. 

On the QSonica machine add 1L milli-Q H2O. Connect both water hoses as appropriate, and set up the system to decrease temperature until 4°C. 
When the system temperature decreases, add ½ L milli-Q H2O (because water level would drop after turn on the machine). 
Start the degasification process, which usually takes 10 min. 

Note: If for some reason the QSonica assembly/system is already done, and you want to use it, you only have to start form degassing step.  

Organize samples into the router in the QSonica center, and place the router in the machine. 

Note: Remember to check the water level according to your sample level, it should be equal or a little bit lower to the sample level. If the water level is over the sample level drain the system to reduce it. If you need add more water, do it, but we hope that is just a little bit of water to avoid the degassing step, again.

Start process on 4°C
Set up system: time = 7:00 min; pulse = 30/30 ; Amplitude = 25°

Note: We found that for PDogs the standard time used before for library preps was t = 6 min (remember that are 2 cycles). The sonication timer depends on the sample  pre-standardization. If it was standarized before, cool, if not, you’ll need do a testing process just with 5 min and changing it according with your results. 

When the first sonicator cycle ends (e.g. first 7 mins) take out the samples, double-check it, dry water excess, and spin tubes. Then, organize samples again in different positions in the router just to avoid the possibility that some samples would receive less or more energy or temperature. Finally, start the new cycle for another 7 mins or the corresponding time. 

Finished the sonication process move out the router, spin the samples 5 seg and storage it on the fridge at 4°C. 

Note: Remember disconnect the hoses and dry the system. 























THIRD STEP: 
SRSLY NGS Library Preparation Kit and Beads Purification (PCR Denaturalization e Incubation)

Before Starting: 
SRSLY Kit is in the frizer at -20°C. :
1 Single Standard (red cap) 
Adapters A (yellow cap) & B (orange cap) 
Master Mix (green cap) 

Note: Single Standard and Adapters should be preserve out of the freezer in cold racks, while Master Mix out of the freezer could be at room temperature until it use. 

Note: SRSLY MM and adapters can only be thawed 4 times or less “technically”. 

Note: Keep in mind that is needed leave the Adapaters and the SS defrost. After that you have to put it back to the cold racks to keep them cold. However, try to work faster and avoid defrost many times the reagents

Remember clean your space with EtOH 70% 
Label and crosslink the whole material to use t = 300 seg = 5 min


Gloves
Sharpies
PCR Tubes triple connection (pre-pre-PCR tubes)
Tips 10 uL and 200 uL
Racks


Turn on 2 thermocycler.  Preheat one thermocycler to T = 98°C and V = 10uL with SRSLY denaturate  protocol, and the other thermocycler at T = 37°C and V = 10 uL in SRSLY incubation protocol to follow the next steps. 

Note: If you only have one thermocycler available, keep in mind that you’ll need wait some time after denaturate for temperature decrease until 37°C. 

Note: You can modify the volume protocol (if you need it).  E.g. 10 uL or other the value. After beep the thermocycle is ready to use. 

Procedure: 
DNA denaturalization 

Flick the sonicator tubes and spin 5 seg before start
Label new PCR tubes (pre-pre-PCR tubes) 
Add 9 uL sonicate DNA in each new tube (pre-pre-PCR tubes) 

Note: Remember make a negative sample with just 9 uL of milli-Q H2O (optional).  

Full vortex and spin 5 seg to SS tube (red cap) before use it. Repeat the process with all samples (3 times - vortex 5 shot pulses)

Take out from the freezer a cold rack and let the pre-pre-PCR tubes there, you have to continue the next steps in cold. 

Note: Try to do the process as fast as possible to avoid freeze the DNA in the rack 

Add 1 uL of SS (red cap) to each pre-pre-PCR tube, remember change tips.

Note: Try to take all the liquid in a perpendicular way, without lean the SS tube, due to that reagent is really viscous. 

Vortex 5 pulses to all tubes and spin 5 seg (3 times) 
Leave the tubes in the thermocycler at 98°C and start running the protocol on the second step, where the samples would be exposed to a thermic shock throughout 3 min. 

Note: Remember attention on the timer. At the end of the 3 minutes inmediately you should move the sample to a cold rack (thermic shock).  

Once finished the 3 min step in the thermocycler you move the sample to a new cold rack and putting flying pressure in the tubes prevent them from coming out. Leave the samples rest on the rack for 2 mins. 

Master Mix Incubation

Note: The next steps have to be make on the same cold rack where you leave the sample to the thermic shock.

Vortex and spin to the Adapters tubes for 5 segs (3 times) before use them. 
Add 1 uL Adaptater A in each sample tube
Add 1 uL Adaptaer B in each sample tube

Flick, vortex and spin the Master Mix per 30 segs before use it (3-5 times), in this case is better over vortex, due to viscosity. 
Add 13 uL MM to each sample tube to obtain 25 uL total volume. Mix the liquid with the tip (optional) and please take care pipetting due to the viscosity.
Vortex (5 pulses ~20 seg) and spin 5 segs to every tube

Note: Take care of over-homogenized the samples

Leave the samples in the thermocycler at 37°C to the incubation step. 
t = ~1h

Note: Remember to put back the SRSLY kit in the freezer. 

Purify SRSLY Reaction using Purification Beads

Before Starting: 
Get ready and crosslink the whole material for at least 5 min (300 seg)


Gloves
PCR Tubes triple connection (final pre-PCR tubes)
Sharpies
Milli-Q H2O (cap open)
3 white plastic troughs (Beads, milli-Q H2O, EtOH 80% fresh)  

Tips 10 uL and 200 uL

 
Note: Allicuotates beads are on the fridge and a bigger one is on the 50mL collection tube covered by aluminum foil, if you need it. 

Note: You will need the white troughs to pour there milli-Q H2O, beads and EtOH 80% to use the multipipettes. Remember that each trough is level with the corresponding reagent. 

Vortex DNA Purification Beads or Beads Solution well before use it, and leave it at room temperature
Prepare EtOH 80% in a 50 mL collection tube to be sure that is completely fresh (40 mL EtOH 80% and 10 uL milliQ-H2O). You can use another prepared yet for at least 1 week, no more.  

Procedure: 

Note: Prepare metal racks. Keep in mind that the volume of beads depends on the liquid volume of the sample tubes. >Beads <Volume = >large DNA fragments.

Note: To save time you can use the multipipettes and troughs 

Remove pre-pre-PCR tubes from the thermocycler
Add 37.5 uL milli-Q H2O to the pre-pre-PCR tubes, then flick it and make a short spin to each tube.

Add 29.25 uL Beads Solution on each tube. Flick mix tubes until you see all of them with the same color. Spin 5 segs. 
Let tubes sit off the plastic rack for 10 min  
Move the tubes to magnet ring rack for 5 min or until clear 

After 5 mins, working on the same magnet rack, remove or aspirate supernatant (~100 uL) and discard

Note: To remove the supernatant allow the tip to touch the bottom of the tube and absorb. Try to recover as much of the supernatant as possible and pay attetion that you have  the same liquid level in the tips.

Add 190 uL EtOH 80% and wait 30 seg
Rapidly, remove supernatant (~200 uL) and discard to avoid damage DNA

Add 190 uL EtOH 80% and wait 30 seg
Rapidly, remove supernatant (~200 uL) and discard to avoid damage DNA
Let dry tube for 5-10 minutes on magnet rings rack with the caps open

Note: 3 min left remove ~10 uL supernatant to be sure that tubes are dry and without EtOH 80%, just take care to don’t super dry samples. 

Move the tubes to a plastic rack and add 15 uL milli-Q H2O in each tube. Flick it in such a way that you mix everything very well, then spin quickly and let it rest 2 mins on the plastic rack. 

Move tubes to magnet parallel rack (optimized to less than 30 uL total volume) and resuspend there for 2 min or until clear.

Note: To put the tubes on the magnet parallel rack apply a little pressure so that the rubes reaim “well attached” to the walls of the rack. So, if you try to move them it will not be easy. 

Take 20 uL supernatant and transfer it to new pre-PCR tubes and discard the other ones.

Note: As you are working over the magnet rack make sure that the tubes are attached to the walls and you can remove the liquid without mixing the beats with the liquid, since the beats remain rimly atteached to the tube walls.

Storage pre-PCR tubes in the fridge at 4°C or in the freezer at -20°C for up to a month. 









































FOURTH STEP: 
PCR

Before Starting: 
PCR Kit
Index PCR 
Index PCR Master Mix
	
Note: On the freezer you will find whole index in two different racks. Remeber it works by pairs (forward and reverse). 

Level and crosslink material 


Gloves
Sharpies
PCR tubes triple connection 
Tips
Racks
TE-Buffer (cap open)
3 white plastic troughs (Beads, TE-Buffer, EtOH 80% fresh)  


Note: To PCR keep in mind an adittional PCR tubes to make duplicates per sample.

Note: The PCR Master Mix is storage on the same SRSLY Kit box, it is thetransparent cap tube. At the same such as the other reagents needs to be defrost, after that you need keep it cold in a rack cold. 

Note: Index are in the -20°C freezer, it needs to be defrost and keep it in a rack cold. 

Note: Before start please remember to check your Google Sheet to know how many cycles would you need to PCR, according with the corresponding samples. Just in case that your samples need different PCR cycles use more than one thermocycler at the same time. 

Procedure: 
PCR

Vortex, flick, and spin PCR MM
Add 12.5 uL PCR MM to the new and empty PCR tubes. You can use the electronic pipette. 
Flick mix and spin index tubes before use them. 
Move the PCR tubes from the plastic rack to a cold rack before add the indexes
Add 2.5 uL of each index to each tube with MM
Flick mix, and spin tubes (library tubes or pre-PCR tubes) 
Add 7.5 uL from pre-PCR tubes to PCR tubes. Flick it, vortex and spin 5 seg the PCR tubes (3 times)

Note: At this point, you fill just 1 tube per sample with a 25 uL total volume. 

Take 12.5 uL from PCR tubes and transfer it to the PCR duplicate tubes. 
Splin whole PCR tubes. 
Let PCR tubes in the thermocycler. Run SRSLY-indexPCR protocol. Change volume value if that is needed. Also, change repetition number (cycles) on step 5 (it depends of you Google Sheet information): Keep in mind, if the sample needs to be run for 8 cycles, the thermocycler needs to say: 7x = 8 repetitions or cycles. It depends of initial concentration. 

Note: Thermocycle process would take ~20min 

PCR sample purification using Purification Beads

Before Starting: 
Crooslink material (racks, new PCR tubes triple connection, TE Buffer) 
Let Beads Solution at room temperature before use it. 

Note: In this step you’ll need to use 3 PCR tubes triple connection per sample. Also, remember that Beads are light sensitive.

At the end of the PCR, spin PCR tubes
Vortex Bead Master Mix tube before use it
Transfer 12.5 uL from PCR duplicate tubes to the “original PCR tubes” and mix it again. Now, the purification process will be 25 uL total volume. Discard empty tubes. 

Add 20 uL Bead Mix tube to each PCR tube, flick it and spin 5 segs
Let tubes sit off the plastic rack for 10 min 
Move tubes to magnet ring rack for 5 min or until clear 
Trasnfer 45 uL from PCR tubes to the new ones. Discard empty tube
Note: In this purification process compared with the last one, you will do it twice changing Beads volume (the step before was for long reads, the next one is for short reads). 

Vortex or flick the Bead Mix Solution before use it (if needed) 
Add 12.5 uL Beads Solution on each tube. Flick and spin.
Let tubes sit off plastic rack for 10 min
Move tubes to magnent ring ranck for 5 min

After 5 mins, working on the same magnet rack, remove or aspirate supernatant (~57.5 uL) and discard

Add 190 uL EtOH 80% and wait 30 seg
Rapidly, remove supernatant (~200 uL) and discard to avoid damage DNA

Add 190 uL EtOH 80% and wait 30 seg
Rapidly, remove supernatant (~200 uL) and discard to avoid damage DNA
Let dry tube for 5-10 minutes on magnet rings rack with the caps open

Note: 3 min left remove ~10 uL supernatant to be sure that tubes are dry and without EtOH 80%, just take care to don’t super dry samples. 

Note: While time is running you will preparing solutions to the next step using the Bionalyzer machine. This just if you’ll follow the next step on the same day, if not, continue the protocol and storage the samples until Bioanalyzer step. 

DNA Dye Concentrate → Transfer whole solution to red cap tube, flick mix, and transfer whole solution to an Eppedorf with filter (Gel Dye Matrix) 

Centrifugate Gel Dye Matrix for 15 min at 2240 g (rcf), then let it at room temperature for 30 min before use.  

Label new and final PCR tubes (CT 001 PCR) on the lid and on the side of the tube. 

Move the tubes to a plastic rack and add 20 uL TE Buffer in each tube. Flick it in such a way that you mix everything very well, then spin quickly and let it rest 2 mins on the plastic rack. 

Move tubes to magnet parallel rack (optimized to less than 30 uL total volume) and resuspend there for 2 min or until clear.

Take 20-25 uL supernatant and transfer it to new final PCR tubes and discard the other ones.
Spin 5 segs to the tubes
Storage final tubes in the fridge at 4°C or in the freezer at -20°C for up to a month

Library DNA Cuantifcation by Qubit

Follow the first protocol to Qubit DNA cuantification 
	
	Note: Don’t forget let the reagents at room temperature before use it. 

Note: In this case over 2 ng/mL is a good DNA concentration. If your result is under that value the “problem” could be on the PCR protocol, maybe it would require 1 or 2 additional PCR cycles. So, you’ll need repeat it. 

Storage library tubes on the freezer at -20°C until Bioanalyzer step 














FIFTH PART
BIOANALYZER

Note: The following is an small protocol to run the samples in the bioanalyzer machine. However, the bioanalyzer have it own protocol to review, it’s with the kit over the fridge or in the draw next to the machine. 

Procedure: 
Placing bionalyzer chip 

Before Starting: 
Defrost PCR library tubes 
Prepare bioanalyzer kit, chip, and samples. You can find it over the fridge, remember let it at room temperature for at least 30 min. 

Note: Remember use gloves to manipulate samples and chip

Note: Kit reagens are light sensitive, avoid exposing them to long light periods 

Add 350 uL mili-Q H2O on each chip corner taking from the drawer under bionalyzer machine. Then, put it on the machine to clean it 30 seg, after that put it out. 

Vortex Gel Dye Mix
Put new chip on the chip priming station with the jeringe 
Add 9 uL Gel Dye Mix on the center of the well marked G possition and burst the bubble
Make sure that the plunger is positioned at 1 mL and then close the chip priming station

Press plunger until it is held by the clip
Wait for exactly 60 seg then release clip
Wait for 5 seg, then slowly pull back the plunger to the 1 mL position

Open the chip priming station and pipette 9 uL of Gel Dye Mix in the wells marked G row. Remeber changing tips. 

Pipette 5 uL of marker (green cap) in all sample and ladder wells. Do not leave any wells empty.

Pipette 1 uL of High Sensibility DNA ladder (yellow cap) in the well marked with an stair 

In each of the 11 sample wells add 1 uL of sample (used wells) or 1 uL marker (unused wells) 

Put the chip horizontally in the adapter and vortex for 1 min at the indicated setting (2400 rpm)
Run the chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument within 5 min 

Reviewing library quality 
On the computer open 2100 Expert Program
Run the chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument within 5 min 
Analyze → double → high sensibility
Fill out sheet with sample information - names → START
