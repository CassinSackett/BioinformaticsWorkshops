# BioinformaticsWorkshops
This repository will contain materials for genomics (lab based) and bioinformatics (cluster based) workshops on topics in conservation genomics.

The workshops will take two forms: a two-day in lab workshop on preparing DNA libraries for whole genome sequencing, followed by a 1-week computer lab workshop on analyzing whole-genome sequence data for conservation and evolutionary genomics. The bioinformatics workshop will begin with a full morning on using bash and the cluster.

Eventually, there will be two copies of the workshop - one in English and one in Spanish.
